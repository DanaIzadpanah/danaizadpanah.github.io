							<h3>Hi ðŸ˜Š, nice to meet you,</br>My name is Dana Izadpanah</h3>
							<p class="major">I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer science at Vanderbilt University.</br>

							<h2>A little bit about me ðŸ™‚ </h2>
							<p>
							Hailing from Sarhasht, Kurdistan, my passion for computer science was ignited at seven when my uncle showed me a simple programâ€”a yes and no popup window. Limited resources in my hometown couldn't quell my thirst for programming. I devoured every available resourceâ€”books, courses, tutorialsâ€”to build a solid foundation in the field.
							</br>
							In 2020, my family and I moved to the United States. The transition, while challenging, opened doors to new resources and opportunities. Despite initial language barriers, I dedicated myself to the task, earning the <a href="https://www.mnps.org/news/archived_news/dana_izadpanah">student of the year award at John Overton High School's Information Technology Academy</a>.
							</br>
							Now, as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, I am not only refining my skills but also forging strong connections with like-minded individuals. My journey in computer science isn't just about mastering codeâ€”it's about harnessing technology to make a positive difference. My goal is to be impactful and use my skills to improve the world, and each day brings me closer to making this dream a reality.

							<h2>Infinity Transportation Inc: Web Application Development</h2>
							<p>In collaboration with Begzod Usmonov, a talented self-taught Software Engineer, we developed a user-friendly static web application for Infinity Transportation Inc.
								 The project leveraged core web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for aesthetics, and JavaScript for interactive elements. </br>
								 Interaction with the business owner provided invaluable insights into the company's specific needs, shaping our design decisions. 
								 This experience underscored the symbiotic relationship between technology and business, and how one can effectively support the other.</br>
								 Working with Begzod was a testament to the power of collaboration. As self-taught Software Engineers, our shared passion for problem-solving led to the creation of a web application tailored to the needs of Infinity Transportation Inc.
								  This project was not only a significant milestone in our professional journey but also an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to delivering tech solutions that exceed client expectations.</br>

							<h2>Building a Comprehensive Sign-Up Page: An Independent Project</h2>
							<p>In a significant endeavor, I independently developed a full-featured sign-up page, utilizing core technologies including PHP, SQL, and HTML. The frontend, structured with HTML, presented a user-friendly interface, while the backend, powered by PHP, managed data interaction dynamically. 
								SQL, with the help of phpMyAdmin, ensured robust user data management.</br>
								The project posed unique challenges, particularly in ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend. 
								This task deepened my understanding of the complex interplay of data within web applications. Despite these hurdles, I successfully implemented a system that allows users to effortlessly create and log into their accounts.
							</br>
							This endeavor underscored the value of independent learning and honed my problem-solving capabilities. It not only resulted in a functional sign-up page but also equipped me with invaluable experience and confidence for tackling future complexities in web application development.

							<h2>Mastery in R and Excel for Effective Data Analysis</h2>
							<p>
								With proficiency in R and Excel, I've carved a niche in the realm of data analysis. R's expansive library and Excel's versatile data manipulation features form the bedrock of my data science toolkit.
							</br>
							My expertise in R spans data visualization, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, contributing to accurate forecasting and insightful data interpretation. Excel complements this by enabling efficient data wrangling and validation, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data inputs.
							</br>
							These skills have been instrumental in research and prediction tasks. For instance, I developed a predictive model using R to forecast product sales, optimizing inventory management for a company. In another case, I leveraged Excel to analyze customer behavior data, leading to impactful marketing strategies.
							</br>
							In essence, my adeptness in R and Excel, combined with my focus on research and predictive analysis, empowers me to contribute valuable, data-driven insights and make informed decisions that benefit organizations.

							<h2>Extracurricular activities</h2>
							<p>
							
							From the classroom to the gymnastics mat, my journey has been defined by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, the art of leadership, and a passion for inspiring others.	
							</br>
							As a Programming Tutor at CodeIgnite, I have been instrumental in guiding young minds from elementary to high school, demystifying Python's fundamental concepts for them. I've used PyGame to engage students, teaching them to build a ski game complete with obstacles, thereby bringing a sense of play to their learning journey. My role extends beyond instruction, preparing lesson plans and providing targeted feedback to students. My commitment at CodeIgnite is testament to my passion for teaching and helping the next generation find their footing in the vast field of computer science.
							</br>
							My leadership abilities found a new arena at the ACM Club of Trevecca Nazarene University, where I served as the Chairman. My primary mission was to revitalize the organization and boost student engagement in computer science. I developed online resources and networking opportunities, fostering a sense of community among computer science enthusiasts, and nurturing their skill development. My time at ACM underscores my dedication to leadership and my zeal for assisting students in their academic pursuits.
							</br>
							Before entering the realm of computer science and academia, my leadership and passion for fostering talent took root in a different settingâ€”the Sardasht Gymnastics Team, which I co-founded and led as CEO. Under my guidance, we cultivated a group of determined athletes, made remarkable strides, and earned recognition in our city's history by competing in the country league for the first time. More than overseeing the team's finances and ensuring the safety of the gym and children, I took pride in leading the team and creating an environment where gymnastics could thrive. My tenure with the Sardasht Gymnastics Team was not just about raising the quality of gymnastics in Sardasht, but also about having a significant positive impact on the lives of the young athletes.
							</br>
							Aside from my professional endeavors, I have also found success in competitive sports. I've earned a state gold medal in both Judo and Jujitsu, demonstrating my commitment to discipline, perseverance, and physical excellence.
							</br>
							With a proven track record in leadership, ability to inspire others, and a relentless thirst for learning, I continue to make a difference in the lives of those I encounter. Whether it's in computer science, sports, or in the community, my goal is to continue serving as a role model and making a positive impact.
